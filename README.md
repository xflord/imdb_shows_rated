# imdb_shows_rated

D3 Visualization summarizing ratings of episodes of select popular TV shows (the attempt was to get all shows with at least one episode ranked above 9.5). However, scraping for the data proved to be more difficult than expected. Still, the amount of data I believe is sufficient and paints a good picture for someone who wants a clear overview of a show's peak (at least based on user ratings), and it's dips (for example last season of GoT).

Some of the shows (only One Piece comes to mind right now) are a bit wonky in the overview window, because a lot of the episodes were missing or jumbled in the data source, and because the show has an outlying amount of episodes which the line graph was not built for. I still decided to keep the show for illustration (and perhaps future improvements)

The radar chart is a modified version of https://gist.github.com/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242

This project is meant solely for educational purposes, all of the data was retrieved using public sources, IMDb pls dont sue
